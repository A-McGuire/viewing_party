# Viewing Party

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/backburnerstudios/viewing_party.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/backburnerstudios/viewing_party)

This application is a means to explore movies and create viewing parties for you and friends.

The application utilizes [Google OAuth](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) 
for [Calendar API access](https://developers.google.com/calendar) to save these events. We also 
use the [Movie DB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) for movie data.
